title: "My second (and last) blog post (for now)!"

This is my second blog post. The thing is, it will probably be my last (or not!?) for now.

# Changes
We've just renamed the blog to "Categories for a Working Homemaker". Notice first that it's 'a', which is one among possibly an infinite... possibilities... of 'homemaker'. Then notice that it's 'homemaker'. This could be as general as one can get, because almost every human at least who is reading this blog is a 'homemaker'. From a mother-of-three-matriarch to a single person in a studio to any human in any place: that human is making some kind of home. You can prepend ajectives at will to 'home'.

# Intention
I'm being asked to focus my energy, and I'm going to try again. So instead of blogging about me learning how to prove stuff rigorously, as I had originally intended, I will just let the energy flow through me and let my stream of consciousness remain a silent and unsaid thing. I mean, that's the intention, anyway. We'll see.

# Repository
That said, I *do* need a place to *put stuff*, like recommendations for books, and maybe some LaTeX code that I find useful. So I guess I'll see whether I can do that here, in an organized way. It may or may not be on this Page; I'm still learning how to GitHub. But either way, it's a bit of a win that this page and these posts exist in the first place.

It also does not escape the realm of the possible for me to just blog anyway because I can't help it. Only iterations of my self will tell.
